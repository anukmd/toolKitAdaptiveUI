Dependencies
- Install Flutter version 3.0.5 and its associated dependencies such as Dart version (2.17.6)
- Install Andriod Studio and configure
- Make sure to run 'adaptive_user_interface_app\lib\main.dart' file

Special Notes:
This toolkit expects Flutter version 3.0.5 and its associated Dart version (2.17.6) to be installed. 
If you have installed latest Flutter version and need to downgrade, use the following steps.
1. Go to the location where flutter is installed (e.g : in Ubuntu /home/[Username]/snap/flutter/common/flutter)
2. Checkout FLutter version using the 'git' command "git checkout 3.0.5"
3. Let Flutter figure out dependencies for the changes we made by running "flutter doctor"
4. Re-run the 'main.dart' file in Andriod Studio
